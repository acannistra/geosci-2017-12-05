# Process Discussion: Two (Three?) Geospatial Analysis Challenges
**[UW eScience Python for Geosciences Seminar, 2017-12-05.](https://github.com/uwescience/Python-for-geosciences/blob/master/tcannistra_20171205)**

## Abstract:
A wide variety of tools exist for the processing of geospatial data in Python. I intend with this brief talk to collaboratively develop two pipelines for geospatial data assimilation and visualization through one or two specific vignettes, chosen from a United States national public lands demography project and a study into worldwide ecological impacts on mining. These are side projects and largely undeveloped, but demonstrate some tools that I find quite useful in quickly extracting and visualizing useful insight from geospatial data in Python, and that hopefully will engage the group and invite sharing of different methods among us.

## Vignette 1: U.S. Public Lands Access [<img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" height=25>](https://github.com/acannistra/parkdistance)

__Problem:__ What effect will executive action on the extent and location of American public lands have on American access to public land across demographics? 

__Deliverables:__

1. Two Maps: one demonstrating current state of access to public lands (across types? parks, forests, wilderness) across CONUS, and another demonstrating the same but with some reduction/removal plan implemented. 

1. Some metric of access broken down by population demographics: are certain demographics proportionally affected by these changes? What's a meaningful metric?

1. Interactive web presence allowing an individual to develop their own "executive action" scenario and observe the effects on access. 


__Extensions:__

* "Access" seems like an interesting but not totally relevant metric. Some sort of economic analysis seems interesting too, but doesn't have as much of a 
geospatial assimilation component.

## Vignette 2: Lake Algae Classification with Sentinel-2 [<img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" height=25>](https://github.com/acannistra/lakeclass)

__Problem:__ Toxic algal/cyanobacterial blooms are a threat to human and nonhuman life; their identification is difficult
