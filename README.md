#Process Discussion: Two Geospatial Analysis Challenges
**[UW eScience Python for Geosciences Seminar, 2017-12-05.](https://github.com/uwescience/Python-for-geosciences/blob/master/tcannistra_20171205)**

## Abstract:
A wide variety of tools exist for the processing of geospatial data in Python. I intend with this brief talk to collaboratively develop two pipelines for geospatial data assimilation and visualization through one or two specific vignettes, chosen from a United States national public lands demography project and a study into worldwide ecological impacts on mining. These are side projects and largely undeveloped, but demonstrate some tools that I find quite useful in quickly extracting and visualizing useful insight from geospatial data in Python, and that hopefully will engage the group and invite sharing of different methods among us.

## Vignette 1: U.S. Public Lands Access

__Problem Statement:__ What effect will executive action on the extent and location of American public lands have on American access to public land across demographics? 

__Deliverables:__

1) Map demonstrating change in accessibility
